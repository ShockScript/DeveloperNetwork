## Lexical scope

An assignment statement is instead a variable declaration if the left operand is an undefined lexical name. If you need to re-declare a variable, use the `Let` keyword.

## Types

- `Any`: dynamic-type reference
- `(A, B)`: tuple
- `Callable`: callable reference
- `Collection`: left-to-right collection. Use `Collection.With(E1, E2, ...)` to quickly initialize a collection.
